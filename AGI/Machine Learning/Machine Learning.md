Machine learning relates to [[AI]], and probably more importantly to the creation of [[AI]]. A diagram over key ideas in machine learning can be found in [[Key Ideas Intro]]!

[[ML chess player]] is a nice analogy for machine learning compared to techniques that  do not utilize this approach. This show how machine learning is a lot about training an intelligence similar to how a human child is trained by its environment.

A very basic example of this process is fitting a statistical model to some training data. For example, [[Linear regression]].

A more advanced side of this is [[Deep learning]] which can handle billions of parameters.

There are also the tasks of machine, the what they are trying to achieve.
- [[Supervised Learning]]
- [[Unsupervised learning]]
- [[Reinforcement learning]]

In all of these the issue of [[task design]] is of great importance.
Moreover, to be effective without our supervision [[generalization]] is key (this can also be called transfer altho not completely the same).
