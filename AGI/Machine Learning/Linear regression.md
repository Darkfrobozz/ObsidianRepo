This is a two value system, you only take one input into account and use that to try and predict your output. Hence, linear.

Example:

Tons of data points on how early you get up.
Tons of data points on how early you go to bed.

Try to find a ax + b = y equation where the prediction is as good as possible.
There are different techniques to do this!
