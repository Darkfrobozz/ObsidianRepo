The weight of edges in between nodes of [[neural networks]] are not specified by the humans who constructed the  deep learning agent rather they are decided by the performance on a specific task. For example, if a specific set of weights triggers the killing of someone that may receive a bad grade, which means that those weights will be avoided.

There are different optimisation algorithms
- [[Gradient Descent]]
