AI stands for artifical intelligence, this is intelligence constructed by intelligence. For example, an enemy in a solo game is most likely governed by artifical intelligence.

This can also describe a field of research designed to produce such aformentioned intelligence.

A very important stepping stone has been [[Symbolic AI]], this has however been shadowed over by [[Machine Learning]] partially because symbolic ai require a lot of computing as they work from the lowest step.
