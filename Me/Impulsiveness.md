This is a trait that I through out my life have fully indulged in, I have lived my life, doing what I feel is best at the moment. Never really putting much effort into the future. Although I wish it had not been necessary, it is so that my relationships breaking me is what really matured me. It showed me the pain of the seeds I had been sowing. The reason for my sadness.

Impulsiveness is the gateway to all other sins I have embraced. There are things I truly [[love]] but just because I enjoy doing things do not mean that I love them. There is a difference between love and pleasure. I do not believe that fault flows from a love of doing what is wrong, I believe fault flows from a lack of love towards doing what is right and impulsiveness letting you therefore lose control of your decisions.

This lack of love could be a lack of understanding what love truly is and what it means for your happiness. Something you can only truly understand once you have done enough exploration into different environment as I myself have done. Although I have not completed my journey I do believe that I have taken great steps towards the truth of our purpose. 

However, the cost for those steps were significant and this is something I must ponder. 

- Do I deserve a second chance for all my reckless indulgence in my impulsiveness?
