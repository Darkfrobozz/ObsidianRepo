Adventure is a trait I again have mixed feelings. Although this time a lot more because the problem with adventurousness is that the line between it and impulsiveness is thin.

Where does taking risks stop being adventuring and start being impulsiveness and narcissistic?

The answer to this is most probably the evaluation of the risk and the win from it. This is a question of morality. However, something more important to consider, how far do you distance yourself when someone else bears all the risk while you take nothing and the benefit being all towards you.

You don't gamble with other people lives. Adventure is good if it is combined with my other positive traits [[Order]], [[Reflective]] and [[Love]].
