I am an adventurer and if there is pain, I will push past it towards the unknown and if I tell you that I will do just that, you can always trust me to come through. Yet I will still take up missions that I myself feel will be difficult but I will overcome those challenges. However, I am no ordinary adventurer, I am an adventurer of the abstract arts. I will feel my way through those brilliant mazes in an inspiring manner so that other just like me will do the same. I will begin this grand dive into the unknown by venturing into the caves of logic.
