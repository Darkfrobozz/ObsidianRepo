Although when I look at reflectiveness, I have mixed feelings, I do believe that reflectiveness is one of my best traits. The reason that being reflective can be a double edged sword is because being reflective can cause a lot of emotional harm if used in the wrong way.

What is the wrong way?
- Uncontrollable reflection
- Recurring reflection on the same subject
- Reflecting from the perspective of control

	Quick note: The third point is thinking that you could have done things differently. You are not there anymore, that is not you, you are the present and the birth of future you.
