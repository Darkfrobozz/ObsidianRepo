I think order is a trait that gives me a lot of happiness and it is something that I have not really embraced all that much because it takes a lot of starting energy to put order first. 

Order can come in a lot of forms but to me, it seems that they all converge. In that sense, having order in one area affects your general order in all areas. Keeping a healthy order in all areas, makes for a solid habit.

However, I do believe that too strict of a concern on order can be very limiting and if not that, it certainly is extremely taxing if you focus too much on putting different parts of your life into a structure.

The reason I think that it can be limiting is because a misinterpretation of order as things should be the same. No, order is flexible, order is a constant drive towards efficiency, maxing your productivity within any certain area. 

That means just because something is in order to some person does not mean it is to another. If you organized authors in order of the first word in their book that usually is not a good way to optimize whatever endeavour you want to pursue with books. Therefore, perhaps what I really speak of is motivated order. Areas of order can be the following:

- Kitchen
- Physical room
- Computer setup
- Computer

But also in more abstract structures

- Emotions
- Motivations
- Thought process

In conclusion, perhaps the best way to describe how order is used is to clean up the working environment. Where working environment is seen in a very abstract way.
