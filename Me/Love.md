Love is a lot of things, love is hard to track and hard to understand but it is a trait that I have. I have a will to do things, I know there are things I enjoy, there is something in things I enjoy that I love. But what those things area I do not necessarily know. That is the reason for this journey of self discovery.

I tapped a little into what I think love in essence is, it is a drive to do something, the reason for providing ratings.

The following are some things that I love:
- Family
- Friends
- Puzzles
- Games
- Community
- Beauty

What it is that I love about these I do not fully comprehend but it will be a big part of my life figuring out the components of these points.
