I didn't eat healthy food today, I went for Burger King. I also received a letter from [[hovr√§tten]] about attending at 2022-10-07 to make my case. I worked on organizing my stuff during the morning I also bought Monolisa which is a font for programmers! I have also cleaned my desktop, fixed the latest version of emacs and taken some new notes on [[Machine Learning]]!
