Valentine woke up, a day no different then any other. The overwhelming swagger oozing from from every corner of his body. He did his morning routine, greeted his dogs and decided to pet the cat. He hopped in his whip and burned rubber. Drove with no direction in mind, except he did. He drove straight to the university. Scanned for vibes just to be confronted by the lack of them. 

The lectures were now over and he had burgers on his mind. He met Ali in central and they headed towards food. Swag.
