Today I spoke to Jonas and his friend Chris.  I also finished work on the [[GeneralizeMicroProject]] and, finally, everything works. I had delicious meals and I am also gonna eat shrimp with a friend.

I will also start a new individual project [[Emacs]] which will cover the learning of this non graphical text editor. I am very excited to start programming in a way that is very efficient and still makes me happy and the least confused.
