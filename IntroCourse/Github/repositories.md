A repository is a place that we have code, a vault, a memory. There is a remote and a local. Each developer has their own but the remote has the true version, the version that all agree on. People can [[push]] onto the remote repository but also [[pull]] to their local repository.

- Boot it up with [[git init]]
- The [[staging area]] can be added to with [[git add]]
- Another command to track the [[staging area]] is [[git status]] 
- [[git commit]] is used to add the [[staging area]] to the repo
- [[branches]]



Remote repos have functionalities such as
- git remote add origin https://github.com/Darkfrobozz/test_.git here you add a git remote onto a git local repo, a link on your local repo, origin is mapped onto the url!!!
- git push -u origin master, origin is mapped onto https://github.com/Darkfrobozz/test_.git nothing more, master is the [[branch]] we are pushing onto and -u is save these settings which mean we don't have to write the url and branch next time!!! Very important!
- [[git config]]
- git pull origin master
