[[Github]] is like an addon to git, git is the version control software. 

git uses [[repositories]] and handles changes between local and remote.

Git can push [[commits]] up and merge it with the content on the remote repository. Git tracks all your commits and to do that it has a bunch of [[branches]]!

You can start with making a local repository

You can see the log of commits with git log.
