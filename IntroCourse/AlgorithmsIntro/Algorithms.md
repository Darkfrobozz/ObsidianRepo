Algorithms are introduced to me in the [[AlgorithmsPdf1.pdf]], where it states that an algorithm always terminates, which is quite different from my previous perspective of algorithms, some terminate, some do not.

There is also information about algorithms and their representation needing to be different than programs. Note:
- Is there syntax for algorithm code?

Two ways are presented for shaping algorithms after a certain problem:
- Top-down
- Bottom-up

It is also specified that an important aspect of algorithm building is to not completly rely on one of these but combine them with a process of identifying what abstractions / functions (says and in [[AlgorithmsPdf1.pdf]]) are necessary.

Ways of building algorithms
- [[Recursion]]

Ways of solving problems:
- [[Divide and conquer]]


Algorithms are often described through a [[flowchart]].
