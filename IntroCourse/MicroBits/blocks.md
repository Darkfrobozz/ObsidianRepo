[[code surface]]


Blocks is a good situation to test the [[SARA]] notation as first of all

- Blocks are natively designed to be executed in order up to down
- Blocks can be executed depending on cases
- Blocks can repeat other blocks
- Functions can be abstracted, hidden from the coder.

You can copy blocks and remove them.

It can also be translated into a programming language

You can create your own functions that can be called upon in other blocks by selecting functions from advanced menu. These functions can be made up by [[parameters]] and, then, called upon with [[arguments]]. These functions can have an output or just side effects.

A nice simple program that utilizes good coding is the [[turning of an arrow]]

In blocks [[arrays]] can be found in advanced
