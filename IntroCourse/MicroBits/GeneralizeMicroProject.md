The plan here is to create a generalization of [[MicroProject_Sketch]].  This will be coded in [[blocks]]. The overview over how a modul will work is [[Generalized Modul]]. Problems that occured:

- How do radio signals work?!!?!?
- How does switching work in micro bits -> what does the stack look like???
	- On earlier what is executed when, say you have input but you are doing some calculations will it skip that input
- Do I need to loop inputs for it to not be missed or does it pause til someone has read the output??


[[Exas]] are a lot better constructed.... Pls improve communication and functionality configuration... debugger is super poor as well, also, why does it lag so much, it is simulating like nothing? Why, why, why???? I am very disappointed in this system.
